      "The Kanto region is where the Pokémon journey first began for many of us.

While its landscapes are modest compared to later regions, its charm lies in its familiarity and nostalgia. Iconic locations like Mt. Moon, Cerulean Cave, and the Pokémon Tower add layers of mystery and lore. Kanto is also where legendary Pokémon such as Mewtwo, Zapdos, and Articuno dwell, marking it as a place where early Pokémon legends were born."
